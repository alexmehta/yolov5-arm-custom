# yolov5-arm-custom

Custom fork of the [Ultralytics Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) repo. Fixed to work on aarch64 with any major issues. This involved removing many libararies (make it barebones/minimalist). 


This is used in **Theia: Assistive Environmental Communication via Audio Patterns for the Visually Impaired** and **Help the Blind See: Assistance for the Visually Impaired through Augmented Acoustic Simulation**.
